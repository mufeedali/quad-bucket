# dir2opds

TLDR: Don't use this.

This is *NOT* based on the official `dir2opds` container. Some of the "Exec" params I've used will not work with the official image.

This makes use of my own builds, where I have added a few features. These features aren't quite ready for general use and are a bit specific to how my library is set up. Check out the code if you'd like to: [link](https://github.com/mufeedali/dir2opds/tree/grouping).
